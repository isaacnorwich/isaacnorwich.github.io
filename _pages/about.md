Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. 

My research interests are broadly in labor and public economics.

Previously, I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow for [Professor Amy Finkelstein](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/amy-finkelstein) at MIT and as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a degree in Economics and Mathematics and am originally from New York City.

My CV is available [here](/files/pdf/Norwich_CV_07-2023.pdf).

You can reach me at [inorwich@uchicago.edu](inorwich@uchicago.edu) or through any of the sidebar links to the left.

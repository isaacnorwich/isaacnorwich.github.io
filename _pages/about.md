I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. 

My research interests are broadly in labor and public economics topics.

Previously, I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow for [Professor Amy Finkelstein](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/amy-finkelstein) and as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a degree in Economics and Mathematics and am originally from New York City.
